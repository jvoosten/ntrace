      <p><a name="example"></a>Okay, so let's get right into it. Let's assume we are writing a Mandelbrot fractal
        program and we want to trace what it is doing. A typical piece of code may look like this:</p>

      <h3>Example code</h3>
<code>
#define ENABLE_NTRACE
#include &quot;ntrace.h&quot;

#include &quot;mandelbrot.h&quot;

TR_MODULE (&quot;Mandelbrot&quot;);

MandelBrot::MandelBrot (float minx, float maxx, float miny, float maxy)
{
  TR_FUNC (&quot;[%f,%f; %f,%f]&quot;, minx, miny, maxx, maxy);

  ....
  value = new int[lines * columns];
  if (!value)
  {
    TR_ERR ("Could not allocate memory!");
  }
  ....
}

void MandelBrot::calculateAll ()
{
  TR_FUNC ();

  for (int i = 0; i < lines; i++)
  {
    TR (NTrace::Info, "line = %d", i);
    calculateLine (i);
  }
}

void MandelBrot::calculateLine (int row)
{
  TR_FUNC ();

  for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++)
  {
    TR (NTrace::Debug, "column = %d", j);
    value[row][j] = calculatePixel (row, j);
  }
}
</code>

      <p>In the first lines we define <strong>ENABLE_NTRACE</strong> that enables some of the macros that are used
        further in the code. If we do not enable this most of the macros evaluate to no-ops (i.e. they vanish from
        compilation). Next we include the main header file, ntrace.h<p>

      <p>The first macro we encounter is <strong>TR_MODULE</strong>; it takes a string as argument that is the name
         of the module. A module is any group of files you think that belong together; it could even be one file. The reason
         to group them together is that a) you can set the debug level for all files in one go, and b) you can filter
         messages for this module.<p>

      <p>Each file that belongs to the same module must use the same name, which is <u>case sensitive</u>. The name is
        free format; for complex projects you could even use hierarchies with dots, dashes or slashes in between. There
      must be one (and only one) TR_MODULE macro in your file in order to allow logging.</p>

      <p>The next macro is <strong>TR_FUNC</strong>; this indicates a function call. The function name is logged,
        as well as any parameters that you supply, in this case 4 floating point numbers. TR_FUNC tracks both
        function entry and exit; two separate log entries are generated.<p>

      <p>Note that TR_FUNC is only called when the line is reached in your program. If you have variables initialized
        inside your function before the macro (possibly with other TR_FUNC macros), this will be done first. You could
        also return before reaching TR_FUNC, in which case neither entry or exit is logged (this is occasionally useful
      in a function which is called a lot but only rarely does some actual work).</p>

      <p>By the way, TR_FUNC is not mandatory in all your functions. You can use all all logging macros without
        this being present; it is only intended for function tracing.</p>

      <p>Next up is <strong>TR_ERR</strong>; this is a special macro that will make sure an error is always logged, even
        if in release mode (more about debug vs. release later).</p>

      <p>Finally, there is <strong>TR</strong>; this short macro takes a debug level, a message and optional
        arguments. This is the workhorse for logging in your program. For each message you determine how important
        it is, which is the first argument. The rule is: the lower the number, the more important it is, with 0 being
        the most important message. NTrace pre-defines the following levels (modelled after syslog):</p>

      <ol start="0">
        <li>Emergency</li>
        <li>Alert</li>
        <li>Critical</li>
        <li>Error (*)</li>
        <li>Warning</li>
        <li>Notice</li>
        <li>Info</li>
        <li>Debug</li>
      </ol>

      <p><sup>*</sup> This is different from the TR_ERR macro.</p>

      <p>However, you are free to determine your own logging levels; if you find typing the strings too cumbersome
        or too detailed, use numbers. I find that in most cases levels 0..3 are sufficient.</p>

      <p>There is one more macro, <strong>TR_OUT</strong>; this behaves similar to TR_ERR but only
        produces output on the standard output and is intented for a quick extra debug message without
        the debug level; it operates independantly from the module debug level.</p>

      <h3>Example output</h3>

      <p>So, after all this work, this might be the output:</p>

      <code>
( 6209) &gt;&gt; Mandelbrot::Mandelbrot(float, float, float, float) ([-2.000000, -1.500000; 1.000000, 1.500000])
( 6209) &lt;&lt; Mandelbrot::Mandelbrot(float, float, float, float)
( 6209) &gt;&gt; void Mandelbrot::calculateAll()
( 6209)   line = 0
( 6209)   &gt;&gt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209)   &lt;&lt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209)   line = 1
( 6209)   &gt;&gt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209)   &lt;&lt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209)   line = 2
( 6209)   &gt;&gt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
....
( 6209)   line = 638
( 6209)   &gt;&gt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209)   &lt;&lt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209)   line = 639
( 6209)   &gt;&gt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209)   &lt;&lt; void Mandelbrot::calculateLine(int)
( 6209) &lt;&lt; void Mandelbrot::calculateAll()
      </code>

      <p>
        The first column shows the process ID; then if a function is being entered (&gt;&gt;) or exited (&lt;&lt;),
        together with the function name and parameter types. Any additional arguments that are declared in
        the TR_FUNC macro are shown as well. Nested function calls are indented (shifted to the right), which makes it easy to
        see where each function call starts and ends.
      </p>

      <p>In this example you do see the TR(NTrace::Info,...) call in calculateAll, but not TR(NTrace::Debug,...) in calculateLine. That is
        because the default debug level is 'Info' for each module. More about this in the <a href="#levels">debug level section</a>.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="main"></a>Inside main()</h2>

      <p>Now if you only read the previous section, added the macros to a program of yours, compiled and ran it, you might be
        disappointed to find that nothing is printed.
        That is because by default NTrace does not output anything; you must configure NTrace to enable one or more output
        channels.</p>

      <p>That's right, one or more output channels. NTrace allows you to simultaneously log to more than
        one destination. The most logical place is to do that inside your main() function (or WinMain() on Windows):</p>

      <code>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  ...

  NTrace::IManager *ntrace_mgr = NTrace::IManager::instance ();
  ntrace_mgr->enableDebugOutput ();
  if (enable_file)
  {
    NTrace::FileOutput *fo = new NTrace::FileOutput ("test", ".log", 1024, 5);
    ntrace_mgr->addOutput (fo);
  }
  ...
      </code>

      <p>Note: in case you hadn't noticed before, NTrace uses the <span class="inline-code">NTrace</span> C++ namespace.</p>

      <p>First, we get a pointer to the Manager object (there is only ever one instance of this object; it's a singleton).
        Then we call <strong>enableDebugOuput()</strong> which adds a default output channel that prints messages
        to stdout/stderr on Linux and the debug console inside Visual Studio on Windows.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><span class="note">Note</span>A Windows program (i.e. one that actually uses a window
          on your desktop, not a command line program) will not produce any output
          if you start it from a shell. That is because such programs do not have
          a concept of standard output. Confusingly though, you can get this output
          if you redirect it to a file with the &gt; operator on the command line:</p>

        <cmds>
C:\Users\Joe\Projects\MyWindowsProject&gt; MyWindowsProject.exe &gt; debug.log
        </cmds>
      </div>

      <p>The next lines create another output channel, in this case a <strong>FileOutput</strong> which
        writes to (surprise, surprise) a file.
        The constructor of FileOutput takes up to 5 arguments but only two are mandatory (for more information, see the
        <a href="doxygen/html/classNTrace_1_1FileOutput.html">Doxygen documentation</a>). Here we set up the output
        to write to &quot;test.log&quot;, rotate the file after 1024 bytes and keep 5 old files around. When the current log
      file is &quot;full&quot;, the file is renamed to test-YYMMDD-HHMMSS.log (where YYMMDD-HHMMSS is the current timestamp)
      and older files are removed.</p>

      <p>All log messages are written to both output channels. Note that if you write to
        stdout or stderr in your program it may not end up exactly between the log
        messages; this is because writing to outputs is handled in a separate thread in NTrace.</p>

      <p>By the way, you don't have to worry that log messages are lost before you enable any output
        channel; they are queued inside the Manager.</p>

      <p>At the moment of writing, only the Debug and FileOutput channels are available; but you
        are free to write your <a href="">own output channel</a>.</p>


      <p>Finally, it is good practice to shut down your logging properly before exiting your program:</p>

      <code>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  ...
  // Initialize NTrace

  ...
  // Do your thing here

  ...
  // Shutdown
  ntrace_mgr->shutdown ();
  return 0;
}

</code>

      <p>This will ensure all pending messages are written and output channels closed properly.</p>


      <h2><a name="debug_release"></a>Debug versus Release</h2>

      <p>You may ask, why not enable DebugOutput by default? Well, we could do that
        but we don't know how you are going to use NTrace. The way I see it there are
        two 'modes' of using NTrace.</p>

      <p>1: you use it to thorougly debug and test your program while developing, then
        disable most of the logging when you are releasing it to your users. This is
        often the case if performance is a concern and/or you don't want to burden
        your users with lots of debugging.</p>

      <p>2: you leave NTrace enabled in your release builds and use it to track
        down bugs or problems while in production. This is often the case if you
        can't halt production but need detailed information (perhaps on a temporary
        basis).</p>

      <p>In the first case you can use the standard <span class="inline-code">ntrace.h</span> include file and
        define ENABLE_TRACE while developing. Perhaps override the TR_ERR macro to
        log real errors to a file (the default writes to stderr, which is not always useful).</p>

      <div class="tip">
        <p><span class="tip">Tip</span>Rather than setting ENABLE_TRACE in every file either set it globally in your compiler settings
          for your project, or even better, create your own header file and enable it there based on your
          debug settings. You can also add extra macros there for your convenience.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The second scenario requires you to properly select the log level when
        using the TR macro. Here you will use a verbose module log level (see below)
        when developing, then scale it down for production. In case there's a
        problem you can increase the debug level for one or more modules
        until you can pinpoint the cause.</p>

      <p>The drawback of the second approach is that all log messages are
        still being generated, and although they are not written this may
        cause significant overhead. A solution is to create your
        own macros for the lowest levels of debugging and disable these
        for production, only generating the more important log messages.
        See <span class="inline-code">ntrace.h</span> for an example
        of how to make macros &quot;vanish&quot; from your code.</p>
