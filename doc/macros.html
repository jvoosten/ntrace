    <h2>Explanation of macros</h2>

    <p><em>Note:</em> The example 'logger.hh' file in the package is meant as an example, but it is
      working. You can change it to your liking or wrap the NTrace calls into objects of your own.
    </p>

    <p><b>TR_MODULE(<i>name</i>)</b> is mandatory for any file that contains NTrace macros; it contains the name
      of the module as a string. This module name is used to select the module debug level; multiple files
      may belong to the same module but all files will use the same debug level. TR_MODULE can be
      used only once per source file.</p>

    <p><b>TR_FUNC(<i>format [, param [, param, ...]]</i>)</b> keeps track of function calls. It does so by defining an object
      within the function that is automatically created and destroyed upon enter and leave.
      The full function name is printed in the tracing output, including optional parameters
      as show in the MandelBrot constructor. The <i>format</i> uses regular C-style syntax using %d, %s, etc.
      It is possible to call TR_FUNC without any parameters.
      <br/>
      Nested function calls are shown indented in the debug output, making it easy to see where a
      function starts and ends.</p>

    <p><b>TR(<i>level, format [, param [, param, ...]]</i>)</b> is the real debugging workhorse.
      It has at least 2 parameters, a debug level
      and a format specifier, followed by any required variables. The debug level in TR()
      is fixed during compilation; the higher the number, the more detailed the information
      should be (note the difference between calculateAll() and calculateLine() in the
      <a href="example.html">example</a>). At runtime
      it is determined if output should be printed or not; if the module debug
      level is higher or equal than the level in TR(), output is produced.<br />

      Note that if the module debug level is lower than the TR() level, there is still
      overhead for calling the NTrace library functions.</p>

    <p><b>TR_ERR(<i>format[, param [, param ...]]</i>)</b> is a macro that will always print a message to stderr,
      even in release mode. It is also logged to the log stream but prefixed with a '!'.
      This macro should be used for severe and/or fatal errors.</p>


    <p><b>TR_OUT(<i>format[, param [, param ...]]</i>)</b> outputs data to stdout, but only in debug mode. It
      is not redirected to the logging output.</p>

    <p><b>TR_READ_CONFIG(<i>stream</i>)</b> reads the configuration from the given stream; this must be of
        type std::istream and already opened.</p>
    
    <p><b>TR_WRITE_CONFIG(<i>stream</i>)</b> writes the configuration to the given stream; this must be
      of type std::ostream and already opened.</p>
    
    <p><b>TR_SET_LOG(<i>stream</i>)</b> has 2 variants; if you supply a std::string for <i>stream</i>, NTrace
      will create a file with the given name and write any subsequent logging to it. If, on the other hand you
      supply a std::ostream pointer, it will use that for the output (so the output can be redirected almost
      anywhere).</p>

    <p><b>TR_SHUTDOWN</b> deletes the NTrace instance and closes all logging streams.</p>
    
    <p><b>TR_LOG_PID(<i>boolean</i>)</b> if the boolean argument is true, the process ID is printed in the log
      output, placed between parenthesis.</p>
    
    <p><b>TR_LOG_TIME(<i>boolean</i>)</b> if the boolean argument is true, the time offset since start of the
      program (actually, the first call to any of the NTrace functions) is printed between brackets []. The
      time is printed as seconds + milliseconds.</p>


    <p>Three things to remember:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a trailing semicolon (;) after each macro.</li>
      <li>Parenthesis are required, even if there are no parameters.</li>
      <li>A linefeed is automatically added to each debug message.</li>
    </ul>
