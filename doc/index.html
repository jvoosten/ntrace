    <h1>NTrace: C++ debugging &amp; tracing library</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Debugging your program, or simply keeping track of what it is doing is never easy.
      <b>printf()</b> statements scattered throughout the code clutter up your source files
      and either produce too much or too little output. Hooking up the program to a debugger can
      show great detail of what the program is doing and why, but doesn't present a clear
      picture of the program flow.</p>

    <p>NTrace is a small library that, in combination with some clever C-style macros, helps
      to track program flow and show only the debug information you are interested in. It is certainly
      not the first, the last or the best debug library, but it might just be what you are looking for.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>printf() style formatting</li>
      <li>Uses C preprocessor; no overhead for production version</li>
      <li>Adjustable debug levels, per file or module</li>
      <li>Tracks function enter and leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, there are a few limitations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Works with C++ only</li>
      <li>Not thread safe (that is, debug information from simultaneously running threads may get interleaved)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic functionality</h2>

    <p>There are two parts in NTrace: a way to keep track of function calls as the
      program enter and leaves them, and print debug info using the printf() syntax.
      The latter has a debug 'level', so that more or less information can be
      printed as desired. This level is set per module and can be changed at runtime.</p>

    <p>A module in NTrace can be a file or multiple files (module); the grouping of source files
      into modules is up to you.</p>

    <p>The NTrace library consists of just a few C++ classes; after installation there will
      be a shared library and some C++ header files on your system.
      However, these classes are <b>not</b> your interface to NTrace;
      rather, an extra header file (sample included) should be copied
      to your project and included in your source file(s). This header file contains C-style
      macros to do all the 'magic' of disabling all tracing when building your production
      version.</p>

    <p>The decision was made to not force this sample header to be <em>the</em>
      interface to NTrace as you may need to tweak the file, depending on your
      project's needs. The header file does work &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;, though.</p>


    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>Let's assume we use a copy of the sample header file and renamed it to <b>logger.h</b>.
      A typical piece of code may then look like this:</p>

    <code style="white-space:pre; padding-left: 2em; background-color: #f0f0f0; display: block;">
#include &quot;logger.h&quot;
#include &quot;mandelbrot.hh&quot;

TR_MODULE(&quot;Mandelbrot&quot;);

MandelBrot::MandelBrot (float minx, float maxx, float miny, float maxy)
{
  TR_FUNC(&quot;[%f,%f; %f,%f]&quot;, minx, miny, maxx, maxy);

  ....
  value = new int[num_lines * num_columns];
  if (!value)
  {
    TR_ERR ("Could not allocate memory!");
    return;
  }
  ....
}

void MandelBrot::calculateAll ()
{
  TR_FUNC ():

  for (int i = 0; i < lines; i++)
  {
    TR (2, "line = %d", i);
    calculateLine (i);
  }
}

void MandelBrot::calculateLine (int line)
{
  TR_FUNC ();

  for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++)
  {
    TR (3, "column = %d", j);
    value[line][j] = calculatePixel (line, j);
  }
}

</code>

    <p><b>TR_MODULE</b> is mandatory for any file that contains NTrace macros; it contains the name
      of the module as a string. This module name is used to select the module debug level; multiple files
      may belong to the same module but all files will use the same debug level. TR_MODULE can be
      used only once per source file.</p>

    <p><b>TR_FUNC</b> keeps track of function calls. It does so by defining an object
      within the function that is automatically created and destroyed upon enter and leave.
      The full function name is printed in the tracing output, including optional parameters
      as show in the MandelBrot constructor. Nested function calls are shown indented
      in the debug output, making it easy to see where a function starts and ends.</p>

    <p><b>TR</b> is the real debugging workhorse. It has at least 2 parameters, a debug level
      and a format specifier, followed by any required variables. The debug level in TR()
      is fixed during compilation; the higher the number, the more detailed the information
      should be (note the difference between calculateAll() and calculateLine()). At runtime
      it is determined if output should be printed or not; if the module debug
      level is higher or equal than the level in TR(), output is produced.<br />

      Note that if the module debug level is lower than the TR() level, there is still
      overhead for calling the NTrace library functions.</p>

    <p><b>TR_ERR</b> is a macro that will always print a message to stderr, even in
      release mode. It should be used for severe and/or fatal errors.</p>

    <p>Three things to remember:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a trailing semicolon (;) after each macro.</li>
      <li>Parenthesis are required, even if there are no parameters.</li>
      <li>A linefeed is automatically added to each debug message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example output</h2>



    <h2>Installation &amp; integration into your own program</h2>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>GCC 4.3 or higher</li>
     </ul>

    ... build

    ...autoconf

    .. tweaking logger.hh

    <h2>Macro reference</h2>

    <p>This section describes the default macro set in detail (of course, you are free to create
      your own macros if you so desire). The macros are divided into three parts:
      those for initialization, adjusting debug output and those used inside
      your functions.</p>

    <h3>Macros for initialization</h3>

    <p>The following macros are typically only called in your main() routine.

    <h3>Setting module debug levels</h3>

    <h3>Function macros</h3>
