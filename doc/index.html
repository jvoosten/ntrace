      <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

      <p>Debugging your program, or simply keeping track of what it is doing is never easy.
        <em>printf()</em> statements scattered throughout the code clutter up your source files
        and either produce too much or too little output. Hooking up the program to a debugger can
        show great detail of what the program is doing and why, but doesn't present a clear
        picture of the program flow.</p>

      <p>NTrace is a small library that, in combination with some clever C-style macros, helps
        to track program flow and show only the debug information you are interested in. It is certainly
        not the first, the last or the best debug library, but it might just be what you are looking for.</p>

      <h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>printf() style formatting</li>
        <li>Uses C preprocessor; little to no overhead for production version</li>
        <li>Adjustable debug levels per module</li>
        <li>Tracks function enter and leaves</li>
        <li>Millisecond timestamping with process and thread ID</li>
        <li>Output can be redirected to multiple targets</li>
        <li>Thread-safe</li>
      </ul>

      <p>However, there are a few limitations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Works with C++ only</li>
        <li>Although NTrace is thread-safe, there is no guarantee messages will be written in order.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The latter is a bit subtle; although messages within a thread will be saved in order, messages
        from other threads with a later timestamp may be written before yours (it all comes down to scheduling).
        Therefore, when looking at a log file it is important to check timestamps in case things do not seem right.</p>

      <h2><a name="basic">Basic functionality</a></h2>

      <p>There are two parts in NTrace:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A way to keep track of function calls as the program enter and leaves them;</li>
        <li>Print debug info using the printf() syntax.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The latter has a debug 'level', so that more or less information can be
        printed as desired. This level is set per module and can be changed at runtime (modules are described below).</p>

      <p>The NTrace library consists of just a few C++ classes; after installation there will
        be a shared library and a few C++ header files on your system. This header file
        also contains macros that provide all logging functionality for NTrace; you are however
        free to create your own macros.</p>
