    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>Debugging your program, or simply keeping track of what it is doing is never easy.
      <b>printf()</b> statements scattered throughout the code clutter up your source files
      and either produce too much or too little output. Hooking up the program to a debugger can
      show great detail of what the program is doing and why, but doesn't present a clear
      picture of the program flow.</p>

    <p>NTrace is a small library that, in combination with some clever C-style macros, helps
      to track program flow and show only the debug information you are interested in. It is certainly
      not the first, the last or the best debug library, but it might just be what you are looking for.</p>

    <h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>printf() style formatting</li>
      <li>Uses C preprocessor; little to no overhead for production version</li>
      <li>Adjustable debug levels per module</li>
      <li>Tracks function enter and leaves</li>
      <li>Millisecond timestamping with process and thread ID</li>
      <li>Output can be redirected to multiple targets</li>
      <li>Thread-safe</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, there are a few limitations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Works with C++ only</li>
      <li>Although NTrace is thread-safe, there is no guarantee messages will be written in order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="basic">Basic functionality</a></h2>

    <p>There are two parts in NTrace:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A way to keep track of function calls as the program enter and leaves them;</li>
      <li>Print debug info using the printf() syntax.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The latter has a debug 'level', so that more or less information can be
      printed as desired. This level is set per module and can be changed at runtime (modules are described below).</p>

    <p>The NTrace library consists of just a few C++ classes; after installation there will
      be a shared library and some C++ header files on your system. This header file
      also contains macros that provide all logging functionality for NTrace; you are however
      free to create your own macros.</p>

    <h2><a name="concepts">Concepts</a></h2>

    <p>NTrace uses the concept of input and output channels. An input channel
      generates log messages and an output channel takes those log messages
      and stores them somewhere, with optional formatting. In the middle is a Manager
      which keeps track of input and output channels and queues log messages.</p>

    <p>There can be multiple input and output channels but there is only one manager.</p>


    <h3>Inputs</h3>

    <p>NTrace comes with one pre-defined input channel: a Module. You define the
      modules yourself by grouping files into them based
    

    <h2>Macro reference</h2>

    <p>This section describes the default macro set in detail (of course, you are free to create
      your own macros if you so desire). The macros are divided into three parts:
      those for initialization, adjusting debug output and those used inside
      your functions.</p>

    <h3>Macros for initialization</h3>

    <p>The following macros are typically only called in your main() routine.

    <h3>Setting module debug levels</h3>

    <h3>Function macros</h3>
